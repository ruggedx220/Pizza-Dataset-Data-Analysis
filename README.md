# Project Description 
This project involves a deep-dive analysis of a pizza sales dataset involves several steps to gain insights into sales patterns, customer preferences, and other relevant aspects. Below is a step-by-step process for conducting data analysis on a pizza sales dataset:
pizza_id: Unique identifier for each pizza. This is likely a reference or primary key for the pizzas in the dataset.
order_id: Unique identifier for each pizza order. Multiple pizzas can belong to the same order, as indicated by sharing the same order_id.
pizza_name_id: Identifier for the specific type or name of the pizza. This may be linked to a separate table that contains details about each pizza type.
quantity: The number of pizzas of a specific type in a given order.
order_date: The date when the order was placed.
order_time: The time when the order was placed.
unit_price: The price of a single pizza unit.
total_price: The total price for the quantity of pizzas in a specific order. It is calculated as the product of quantity and unit_price.
pizza_size: The size of the pizza (e.g., S for Small, M for Medium, L for Large).
pizza_category: The category or type of pizza (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Chicken, Supreme).
pizza_ingredients: A list of ingredients that make up the pizza. This column provides information about the toppings or components of each pizza.
pizza_name: The name or label of the pizza. It is likely a human-readable identifier for the type of pizza, corresponding to the pizza_name_id.
